# CHAOS
The world we deserve.

## Targets
1. Help me understand both quantum theories and theories of general relativity/special relativity better.
2. This can be a playground for me to build a world or intelligence using computer science technology.
3. Focus on building a real random and chaos system based on quantum theories via computer science, rather than the sudo-random in computer science.
4. Introduce concepts of dimensions into this "simulated" world. Let's see what could happen.

## To you
Any suggestion is welcome for helping building it.
